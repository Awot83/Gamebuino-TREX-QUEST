# Gamebuino-TREX-QUEST
My first game for Gamebuino, made with my son who likes T-Rex :) 

Features are :
- Score counter
- Health bar
- Fire bar
- add a hitbox on the TREX and the TANK
- Sometimes a random chily appears instead of an apple (chance : 1/10) the chily allow the TREX to fire with a mega ray blaster all over the screen.
- i used Split H function on the "fire" sprite, instead of a different sprite of fire splited on the left
- intro and logo at the starting page
- Level 1 / Level 2 / Level x according to the score, 100 = next level
- The tanks speedup at each level
- Add a game over screen at the end, with the score 

i have updated T-REX QUEST with :
- differential scrolling, 
- cars, 
- background city, 
- no transparency.  :)
- and changed some others things
